Orko

Orko is a "Trollan", a race of beings from Trolla, a world in another
dimension. Trollans wear red robes, red hats, and hide their faces beneath
hats and behind scarves. In Trollan society, showing one's face to each other
is considered an intimate act, similar to humans sharing a kiss. 

Orko the program, is a quick hack at a keychain + GUI app using electron.
